    <h1>Julia Set Visualisation</h1>
    <p>The Julia Set can be used to show beautiful fractal patterns if used correctly.</p>
    <p>
        Essentially what is happening is that the canvas represents the complex plane and for each pixel on the canvas,
        the location is iterated using the equation f(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c for some constant c.
        This is iterated until the result lies outside a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. For
        each pixel, the number of iterations taken is found and the pixel colour is changed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The constant, c, can be changed by moving the mouse across the screen. The y axis represents the imaginary part
        and the x axis represents the real part of the complex number. Notice how all Julia sets that are entirely real
        are symmetrical. Both the real and imaginary components can be varied between 1 and -1. The most interesting
        features occur with the mouse on the left side of the screen however experiment and see what you can find!
